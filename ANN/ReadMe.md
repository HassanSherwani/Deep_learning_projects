# Handwriting recognition : <br>

The standard example for machine learning these days is the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of the numbers 0-9.<br>

# Problem statement<br>

To predict which number each handwritten image represents.

# Dataset<br>

Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, so we can treat each image as just a 1D array, or tensor, of 784 numbers.<br>

# Modules<br>

tensorflow <br>
matplotlib<br>
numpy<br>
