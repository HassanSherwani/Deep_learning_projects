# Logistic Regression <br>
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.<br>

Sometimes logistic regressions are difficult to interpret; the Intellectus Statistics tool easily allows you to conduct the analysis, then in plain English interprets the output.<br>

# Problem Statement <br>
Will use regression method to minimize loss function(error). We 'll check our model before training and after training.<br>

# Libraries used <br>

pytorch
