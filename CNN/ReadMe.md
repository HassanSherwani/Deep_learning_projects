# Handwriting recognition<br>
The standard example for machine learning these days is the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of the numbers 0-9.

# Problem statement<br>
To predict which number each handwritten image represents.

# Dataset<br>
Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, so we can treat each image as just a 1D array, or tensor, of 784 numbers.

# Modules<br>
tensorflow <br>
keras <br>
matplotlib <br>
numpy <br>
