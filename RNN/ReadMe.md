# RNN

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition

# Handwriting recognition<br>
The standard example for machine learning these days is the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of the numbers 0-9.

# Problem statement<br>
To predict which number each handwritten image represents.

# Dataset<br>
Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, so we can treat each image as just a 1D array, or tensor, of 784 numbers.

# Modules<br>
tensorflow <br>
keras <br>
matplotlib <br>
numpy <br>
